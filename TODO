we need to make a bit more of a distinction between a details page (radar), and media on sound platform such as mixcloud/soundcloud (rinse, nts) 

if the platform allows you to ge to the media in one-click, expose the option, but otherwise we need better names

also might make sense to break up the host from the path in our urls given we are supporting multiple paths for pagination..
